Content varies over time and may not be available in all countries. After the free trial period, subscription continues to be charged at the then-current regular price (subject to change) plus applicable taxes unless cancelled. You can cancel your subscription by accessing Services & subscriptions in your Microsoft account. If you play Minecraft through Xbox Game Pass, Marketplace Pass is a separate subscription. You will need to purchase and cancel each subscription separately. We may occasionally provide content that remains available to you even after the end of your subscription, in which case we reserve the right to take down such content if it becomes incompatible or if our rights to the content expire. If your subscription terminates or a content item is removed from the catalog, you must reactivate your subscription or buy the content separately to continue using it. ISP fees may apply.
